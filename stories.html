      <h2>Story #1</h2>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Challenge:</strong> A faculty member’s computer was set to be decommissioned and they needed to pull their files off of it. However, the rear case fan had gone out and my supervisor wasn’t going to order a new one for a computer that was about to be decommissioned.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Due to the age of the computer, it had different bios and format settings than the newer computers within our support area. As a result of this, throwing the hard drive in a different computer and using a hard drive to usb device were unsuccessful in recovering the files from it.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Response:</strong> I decided that the only way to solve the problem was to find a way to get the computer working. I ended up using a can of air to get the rear case fan spinning long enough that it would trick the computer into booting. The faculty member was then able to retrieve their files off of it and it was decommissioned.
      </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Story #2</h2>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Challenge:</strong> A staff member’s iMac wasn’t loading past a grey screen when the power button was pressed.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> I first tried resetting the PRAM and launching into safe mode. Neither were working.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Response:</strong> I ended up unplugging all peripherals from the iMac besides the keyboard and mouse. It then booted up without any issues. I then plugged all of them back in and it failed to boot. Finally, I unplugged all of them, it booted and then once logged in, I reconnected all of them.
      </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Story #3</h2>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Challenge:</strong> A faculty member’s Dell laptop was failing to start up due to a startup registry error.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> I tried working with the diagnostics menu and ended up in a loop, that didn’t appear to be going anywhere.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Response:</strong> I renamed the startup files on the professor computer with .OLD and then replaced them with startup files from a newly made Windows 10 installer and it booted right up.
    </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Story #4</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
      <strong>Challenge:</strong> A computer had an incorrect naming convention is Active Directory and it had to be corrected.
    </p>
    </div>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Action/Response:</strong> I began by creating a new computer in active directory with the correct naming convention, I then went to the physical computer and ensured it had a local administrator account and then pulled it off of the domain, renamed it and then put it back on the domain. Finally, I deleted the old entry from active directory.
    </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Story #5</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
      <strong>Challenge:</strong> Organize the summer projects into one easy to read document that all team members have access to and can understand due to the involved team members working on different days.
    </p>
    </div>
      <div>
      <p>
      <strong>Action/Response:</strong> I began by creating a Google Sheet in our shared internal folder. I separated all of the tasks into different categories, such as classrooms, school of study and building. Then I organized those tasks into multiple sheets. Within each sheet there was a list of tasks. Each task began with a traffic light style color code to indicate that the task had either not been started, was in progress or had been completed. Each task also included the room number, a task description, start and completion date and an area to add relevant notes about the task. With this document, we were able to complete all of our tasks in a small amount of time due to being able to quickly see what needed done and plan accordingly.
