          <h2>Short Biography</h2>
          <p>Hello, my name is Joshua. I am currently a senior Digital Sciences major at Kent State University. My anticipated graduation date is May 2019. I have nearly two years of experience working within IT but I have at least six years of being a computer hobbyist. My computer related hobbies include things such as building multiple desktops from scratch, designing websites, including this one and experimenting with graphic design work. In terms of my real-world experience, I have completed a variety of tasks such as imaging and managing computers, setting up new machines such as Apple TVs for conference mode and overseeing other students. Please see my resume page for full details on my experience and skills. </p>
