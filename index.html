          <h2>Short Biography</h2>
          <p>Hello, my name is Joshua. I am a Kent State University graduate, having received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Digital Sciences in May of 2019. During my time as a student, I spent two and a half years working in IT for the College of Communication and Information at Kent State. In this position, I started out as a Student Computer Technician and quickly worked my way up to Sr. Student Computer Technician. Through this role, I was able to acquire a variety of skills such as imaging and managing computers through Active Directory and SCCM, setting up new machines, overseeing other students, and creating a variety of instructional tutorials for other technicians as well as end users. Please see my resume page for full details on my experience and skills. In my free time, I am also a computer hobbyist. My computer related hobbies include things such as building multiple desktops from scratch, designing websites, including this one, and experimenting with graphic design work. </p>
